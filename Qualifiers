C-Type Qualifiers

Qualifiers:  The keywords which are used to modify the properties of a variable are called type qualifiers.

There are two types of qualifiers available in C language.
1. Const: Explained in prior document.
2. Volatile

Volatile keyword is of great use for Embedded Apllications.
Suppose we are waiting UART to change the value using ISR which is not expected by the processor to change in that case the compiler will 
optimize the code. In that case the code will not check that value again and will consider it as fixed. 

So the value of the variable that we think may change and compiler may think that it will not change in future and will optimize the 
assembly code than in that case we use keyword "Volatile" before that variable => this means we are telling compiler not to optimize
                                                                                  as this is a volatile variable(which may change).
