=> i++ is known as Post Increment whereas ++i is called Pre Increment.

1. i++

i++ is post increment because it increments i's value by 1 after the operation is over.

Lets see the following example:

int i = 1, j;
j = i++;
Here value of j = 1 but i = 2. Here value of i will be assigned to j first then i will be incremented.

2. ++i

++i is pre increment because it increments i's value by 1 before the operation. It means j = i; will execute after i++.

Lets see the following example:

int i = 1, j;
j = ++i;
Here value of j = 2 but i = 2. Here value of i will be assigned to j after the i incremention of i. Similarly ++i will be executed 
before j=i;.
